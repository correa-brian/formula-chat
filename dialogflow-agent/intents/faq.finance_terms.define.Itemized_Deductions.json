Itemized deductions include Mortgage Interest, Charitable Contributions, Student Loan Interest, Gambling Losses, and Medical and Dental Expenses (above 10% of AGI). They also include State and Local income taxes and personal property or sales taxes up to $10k. Unless your total itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction for your filing status ($12,200 for Single Filers, $18,350 for Head of Household filers and $24,400 for married persons filing jointly), you will save more money by taking the standard deduction and not itemizing."
