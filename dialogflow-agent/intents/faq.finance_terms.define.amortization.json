Say you buy a license for $10k, and the license expires in 10 years, each year the license loses some of its value. Instead of taking a $10k deduction the year you buy the license, you must take a $1k deduction each year of the useful life of the license (10 years). There are more complicated ways of amortizing, but this simpler method is known as the Straight-Line method. "
