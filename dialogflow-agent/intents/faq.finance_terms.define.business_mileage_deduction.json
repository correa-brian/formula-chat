For 2019, you can take $0.58 per mile driven from your taxable income (note: this excludes taxi cabs and vehicles used as equipment, like a dump truck). When you\u0027re not commuting you can track your miles and earn a deduction for driving to meetings with clients and attending a meeting away from your normal place of business."
